I'm Benjamin Klotz, a Software Engineer based in Tyrol, Austria with 5 years of experience.

I started my career with PHP where I mainly worked with Symfony and eZ Publish (now Ibexa). Then moved on to Ruby and mainly using Rails as framework of choice.
Nowadays I'm learning more JavaScript and TypeScript which I am using together with NodeJS on the back-end.

Docker and Kubernetes are a constant companion as well and I'm learning more everyday I use it.

# Personal Interests

Besides loving to learn about new technologies or gaining more in depth knowledege about already used technologies I have a big passion for sports and fitness.
I love long full day hiking trips, do 2-3 runs per week and love getting more in shape after years of living a unhealthy lifestyle.
