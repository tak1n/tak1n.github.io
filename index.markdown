# Me 👨‍💻

Hi 👋 I'm Benjamin, 30 years old and based in Tyrol, Austria. Currently I'm working at [onlim](https://onlim.com/) as software engineer with a focus on backend and DevOps.
After graduating from [HTL Innsbruck](https://htlinn.ac.at/) where I came in contact with hardware and software side of the world I decided to fully focus on software.

The first 2 years I spent working for a web agency where I worked with [PHP](https://www.php.net/) ([Symfony](https://symfony.com/), [eZ Publish](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-community)).
Followed by a position at [STI Innsbruck](https://www.sti-innsbruck.at/) as a full-time [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) ([Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)) developer. Branched off from STI I moved on working for onlim where I'm still employed to date.

During the whole time working as developer I was curious to learn new things, but also trying to get a detailed understanding of the technologies I use. Nowadays I'm learning and using more JavaScript, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) on the backend. In my spare time I'm currently experimenting with Microcontrollers ([Arduino Uno R3](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3), [ESP8622](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266), etc) and [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/).

Also I'm a big believer in OSS and try to give back to it by either contributing or sponsoring:

# Non coding ⛰️ 🏃

Besides loving to learn about new technologies or gaining more in depth knowledege about already used technologies I have a big passion for sports and fitness.
I love long full day hiking trips, do 2-3 runs per week and love getting more in shape after years of living a unhealthy lifestyle.

If you are interested in my sport activities consider to follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/70701998) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bk_cupra/).
