# Coding

Hi, my name is Benjamin Klotz. I'm a Software Engineer based in Tyrol, Austria with 7 years of experience.
My heart is beating for back-end, DevOps and Linux.

I focus on delivering docker based solutions while adhering to clean code principles and practicing TDD.

### Core skills

- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- TypeScript
- NodeJS
- NestJS
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- CI/CD

I started my career with [PHP](https://www.php.net/) where I mainly worked with [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) and [eZ Publish](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-community). Then moved on to [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and mainly using [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) as framework of choice.
Nowadays I am learning more JavaScript and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) which I am using together with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/) on the back-end by leveraging [NestJS](https://nestjs.com).

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) are a constant companion as well and my knowledge of it increase every day I have the chance of using it.

# Non coding

Besides loving to learn about new technologies or gaining more in depth knowledege about already used technologies I have a big passion for sports and fitness.
I love long full day hiking trips, do 2-3 runs per week and love getting more in shape after years of living a unhealthy lifestyle.
